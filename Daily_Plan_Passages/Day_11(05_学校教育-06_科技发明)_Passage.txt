The Young Inventor's Challenge (青年发明家挑战赛)

At the state polytechnic institute, a nervous row of students stood in a queue, waiting to register for the annual innovation fair. Among them was Leo, a brilliant student who hoped to apply for a fellowship or at least win a scholarship to cover his tuition fee. He knew he shouldn't underestimate the competition, nor overestimate his own abilities, but he was determined to specialise in the field of robotics.

Leo's goal was to devise a versatile gizmo—a robotic explorer designed to uncover secrets in hazardous environments. To finance his project, he had secured a small grant from a local foundation. Now, he had to concentrate and focus all his energy to innovate a real breakthrough.

For months, Leo worked as both engineer and mechanic. He began to assemble the device in the lab. The robot featured a hydraulic pump and a gear system acting as a pivot for movement. He decided to attach a high-definition vision system, including a microscope lens and sophisticated optics to examine tiny particles. He also installed a radar and an echo sensor to gauge distance and detect obstacles. The internal equipment was complex. Leo used a microcomputer to process the data.

He spent weeks writing software, typing away on his keyboard and staring at the screen, translating his logic into binary and digital code. The robot could measure temperature, count samples, and calculate environmental risks. It could even absorb solar energy to recharge. To test its multimedia capabilities, Leo added a loudspeaker and a microphone. Interestingly, he included a retro cassette tape player as an auxiliary backup for audio recording, in case the wireless network failed. He opened a browser on his laptop to check the connection. "System check," he said, turning a dial on the control panel. The robot responded instantly.

Finally, the day came to disclose and reveal his creation. He had to expose his work to the judges. Acting as the lead tester, Leo demonstrated how to utilise the machine. He showed how to apply the robot to search-and-rescue missions. The judges watched the usage of every tool and instrument. They had to assess and evaluate whether this appliance was practical or just fantasy and science fiction.

The robot worked perfectly. The heat generated was just a minor byproduct. Leo verified the data, helping the judges compute the efficiency. The head judge offered feedback: "We appreciate your hard work. You did not just gather parts; you created a solution."

Leo received the top prize—a substantial reward and an award for excellence. The judges promised to praise his work to investors, potentially helping him patent the technology. It was a major advance in his career. As he left the realm of the competition, he felt he truly belonged in the world of invention.

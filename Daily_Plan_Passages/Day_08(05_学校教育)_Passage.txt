The Academic Odyssey: From Fresher to Scholar
Looking back as an alumni of the university, I can still vividly recall my first day on campus. As a naive fresher, the sheer scale of the university felt overwhelming. I logged onto the digital platform to complete my matriculation and register for classes. The roster for the popular courses filled up quickly, so I had to enrol immediately. The orientation week helped us navigate the coed accommodation; I was lucky to get a room in a quiet dorm near the dining hall (or canteen), where the food quality was surprisingly good, though the quantity was sometimes lacking.
My journey through the academic ranks—from fresher, sophomore, junior, to senior—was defined by my choice of study. I decided to major in Economics with a minor in Statistics. This meant my schedule was a merger of social sciences and mathematics. I studied sociology, politics, marketing, accounting, and even learnt how to audit a company's financial record.
However, I didn't limit myself. I was curious about everything. I took electives in psychology, philosophy, and logic to sharpen my mind. I explored the natural world through biology, physics, chemistry, and agriculture. I even dabbled in engineering, mechanics, and electronics, and learned about global trade logistics. My geography and history classes gave me context about the world.
A significant portion of my time was spent in the library. It was a sanctuary of knowledge containing every category of literature. I would browse the catalogue and check the index to find a specific volume or chapter for my research. Whether it was a fictional tale, a classic story, a biography of a famous author, or an anthology of poetry, I devoured it all. I read every article in the academic journal and popular magazine relevant to my subject.
Research required precision. I spent hours in the laboratory conducting an experiment to gather data. I had to maintain a detailed inventory of my sources in a bibliography. Sometimes, I would watch a documentary series or listen to an old audio reel to find a profile or a sketch of a historical figure. I kept a file of every draft and manual I wrote. I even referenced an encyclopedia and a brochure to understand the content of a documentary.
Of course, the foundation of my degree was maths. From basic arithmetic to complex calculus, algebra, and geometry, numbers were everywhere. I learned to add (using plus), subtract (minus), multiply, and divide. Solving an equation required finding the sum or total. In finance, we calculated the dividend; in research, we ensured the object of study was identical to the control group.
After four years, I received my bachelor's degree. But my thirst for knowledge wasn't quenched. I continued to study for a master's and eventually a doctor's degree. Now, as I write this diary entry, I realize that university is not just a list of subjects; it is a life-changing narrative.
